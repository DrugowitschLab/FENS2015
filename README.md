Code and notes for FENS 2015 Winter School on decision-making
=============================================================

This repository contains all the MATLAB code used to generate the figures for my tutorial on normative solutions to the speed/accuracy trade-off, held at the FENS-Hertie 2015 Winter School on the neurobiology on decision-making. Additionally, it provides the notes [fens2015_notes.pdf](fens2015_notes.pdf) that detail the derivations. Each code directory corresponds to one section in the notes.
