Code and notes for FENS 2015 Winter School on decision-making
=============================================================

This repository contains all the MATLAB code used to generate the figures for my tutorial on normative solutions to the speed/accuracy trade-off, held at the FENS-Hertie 2015 Winter School on the neuroscience on decision-making.

The derivations that result in these figures are provided in the [tutorial notes](https://sites.google.com/site/jdrugo/pub/pdf/fens2015_notes.pdf). Further information is provided on the [tutorial slides](https://sites.google.com/site/jdrugo/pub/pdf/fens2015_slides.pdf)
