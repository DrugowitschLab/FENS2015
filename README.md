Code and notes for FENS 2015 Winter School on decision-making
=============================================================

This repository contains all the MATLAB code used to generate the figures for my tutorial on normative solutions to the speed/accuracy trade-off, held at the FENS-Hertie 2015 Winter School on the neuroscience on decision-making.

The derivations that result in these figures are provided in the [tutorial notes](http://drugowitschlab.hms.harvard.edu/files/drugowitschlab/files/fens2015_notes.pdf). Further information is provided on the [tutorial slides](http://drugowitschlab.hms.harvard.edu/files/drugowitschlab/files/fens2015_slides.pdf)
